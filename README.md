PPS: GitHub has started naming the default branch main instead of master to migrate away from biased terminology (more details available here). In accordance with this industry-wide movement, we have also updated "Learn Git Branching" to use main instead of master in our lessons. This rename should be fairly consistent by now but if you notice any errors, feel free to submit a PR (or open an issue).
